            According to the Indian Law Commission, legal education is a comprehensive science that imparts knowledge of specific principles and legal provisions to students, enabling them to enter the legal profession with a robust foundation. This education goes beyond mere academic learning; it aims to cultivate a social conscience in future lawyers, emphasizing their role in society. The primary goal of legal education is to produce competent legal professionals who are not only adept at navigating the legal system but also committed to upholding justice and advocating for societal welfare.
            <br>
            <br>
                In the modern era, the scope of legal education has expanded significantly. It is now seen not only as a means to produce lawyers but also as a critical tool for social design. This broader perspective recognizes that legal education can influence societal norms and values, shaping a more equitable and just society. By instilling a deep understanding of legal principles and social responsibilities, legal education equips students to become agents of change who can address various social issues through legal frameworks.

                <li>Governmental policy:</li>
                <p>Government policies and regulations play a significant role in shaping the legal education system in India, including funding, accreditation, and curriculum development.</p>

                <li>Bar council of India: </li>
                <p>The Bar Council of India (BCI) is the regulatory body for legal education in India, and its policies and decisions can have a significant impact on the legal education system.</p>

                <li>University grants commission: </li>
                <p>The UGC is responsible for funding and regulating legal education in India. It sets standards for accreditation and curriculum and provides funding for legal education institutions.</p>

                <li>Affiliating universities:</li>
                <p>Universities play a major role in shaping legal education in India through their affiliating role with law colleges. They have the power to approve the curriculum, faculty, and infrastructure of the law colleges.</p>

                <li>The private governing body of law colleges:</li>
                <p>Many law colleges in India are run by private governing bodies, which have a significant influence on the direction and focus of legal education in these institutions. These bodies set the admission criteria, and fees, and have a major role in the decision-making of the institutions.</p>

                <li>National litigation policy:</li>
                <p>The government’s national litigation policy can also influence legal education in India by shaping the demand for legal professionals with specific skills and expertise.</p>

                <h2>Legal education institutions</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Over the past ten years, private universities have taken a significant part in studying how legal education has changed. They work in the area of legal education and make an effort to raise the standard of legal instruction in India. National Law Schools, on the other hand, placed a strong emphasis on specialised education.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Many institutions have decided to completely abandon the lecture method of instruction in favour of more engaging and creative learning techniques. Moot courts are a common practice in Indian law schools, which has made legal education more practical and behavioural than merely learning the letter of the law.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The importance of extracurricular activities like seminars, workshops, and other events has now been integrated into the curriculum. The requirement for internships during the study period has been changed to mandatory. On-campus hiring has become a standard practice at the majority of law schools.</p>

                        <br>

                        <li>Professionalism: There have been concerns about the lack of professionalism and ethics among some lawyers in India, which can negatively impact the legal profession and the administration of justice.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Legal aid and access to justice: India’s legal aid system is underfunded and overburdened, which can make it difficult for people from marginalized communities to access justice.</li>
                        <br>

                        <li>Research and innovation: There is a lack of focus on research and innovation in legal education in India, which can limit the development of new ideas and approaches to legal issues.</li>
                        <br>
                    </p>

<br>
<p>Hence, the scenario of legal education is becoming more and more specialized as was envisioned by the well-wishers of the legal profession.</p> -->
