            According to the Indian Law Commission, legal education is a comprehensive science that imparts knowledge of specific principles and legal provisions to students, enabling them to enter the legal profession with a robust foundation. This education goes beyond mere academic learning; it aims to cultivate a social conscience in future lawyers, emphasizing their role in society. The primary goal of legal education is to produce competent legal professionals who are not only adept at navigating the legal system but also committed to upholding justice and advocating for societal welfare.

            <br>
                In the modern era, the scope of legal education has expanded significantly. It is now seen not only as a means to produce lawyers but also as a critical tool for social design. This broader perspective recognizes that legal education can influence societal norms and values, shaping a more equitable and just society. By instilling a deep understanding of legal principles and social responsibilities, legal education equips students to become agents of change who can address various social issues through legal frameworks.
